# API & Plugins ðŸ”Œ

* **Module:** `plugin-api`
* **Depends on:** N/A
* **Resources:** Good API design principles are essential. Think about what a plugin developer needs to access and
  change without breaking the core server.
* **What you should look at:**
    * **Event System:** Implement a robust event bus. The core module will dispatch events (e.g., `PlayerJoinEvent`,
      `BlockBreakEvent`), and plugins can register listeners to react to them. This is the primary way plugins will
      interact with your server.
    * **Command System:** Provide an API for plugins to register new commands. This should handle parsing command
      arguments and executing the appropriate plugin logic.
    * **Public Interfaces:** Define public interfaces for accessing core components like the `World`, `Player`, and
      `Inventory`. **Do not expose the internal implementation**; only provide the necessary methods for a plugin to
      function.
